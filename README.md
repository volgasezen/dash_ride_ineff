# NYC Taxi Inefficiency Dashboard
plot.ly Dash app that visualizes taxi inefficiency across NYC.

Pulls data from an optimized PostgreSQL database and shows a map of NYC zones. Fill color based on the inefficiency metric (bird-flight distance/ride distance). Overlay includes borough name, zone name, number of rides that day (or hour), and the inefficiency amount.
