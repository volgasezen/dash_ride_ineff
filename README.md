# NYC Taxi Inefficiency Dashboard
plot.ly Dash app that visualizes taxi inefficiency across NYC.

Pulls data from an optimized PostgreSQL database and shows a map of NYC zones. Fill color based on the median inefficiency metric (ride distance/bird-flight distance). Overlay includes borough name, zone name, number of rides that day (or hour), and median inefficiency amount.
